- [Svelte UI](https://github.com/svelteuidev/svelteui)
- [Sveltestrap](https://github.com/bestguy/sveltestrap)

Since all Libraries/Frameworks have a different number of components, the most important ones have been selected in this example and compared with each other. For a complete list of components, visit the website of the respective framework.
It is recommended to view the website on a device with a larger screen so that the frameworks can be better compared with each other.
